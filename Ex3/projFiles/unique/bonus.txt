We've added a random batch tester.

You can try it out by running batch_random_tester.sh
This tester runs random_tester.sh, which generates a random sized map(MaxSteps and Bullet Count are constant and need to be changed manually).
The tester does this 100 times, and saves the runs. At the end, the tester waits for user input, and based on it erases\keeps the files generated.

To check out the tester, run the following commands:
chmod +x ./random_tester.sh
chmod +x ./batch_random_tester.sh
./batch_random_tester.sh

Note: This will take some time! Some boards can be pretty complex. You can decrease the amount of boards generated if you'd like, however.

P.S: There's also an easter egg in the file!
